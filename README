NAME
    File::Slurp::Chomp - Add autochomping capability to File::Slurp

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Instead of:

     use File::Slurp qw(slurp ...);

    use:

     use File::Slurp::Chomp qw(slurp ...);

    and in addition to File::Slurp's features, you can also:

     my $scalar = read_file('path', chomp=>1);
     my @array  = slurp    ('path', chomp=>1);

    You can also import read_file_cq or slurp_cq (short for "chomp & quiet")
    as a shortcut for:

     read_file('path', chomp=>1, err_mode=>'quiet', ...);

DESCRIPTION
    Autochomping is supposed to be in the upcoming version of File::Slurp,
    but I'm tired of waiting so this module is a band-aid solution. It wraps
    read_file() (and slurp()) so it handles the chomp option.

FUNCTIONS
    For the list of functions available, see File::Slurp. Below are
    functions introduced by File::Slurp::Chomp:

  read_file_cq($path, %opts)
    Shortcut for:

     read_file('path', chomp=>1, err_mode=>'quiet', ...)

  slurp_cq($path, %opts)
    Alias for read_file_cq().

SEE ALSO
    File::Slurp, obviously.
